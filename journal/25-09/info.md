## Storyline of the Movmement

One snowy winter day, you are outside, middle of nowhere, cooking in front of a campfire.
You realise your robot pet is shivering, and decided to cover a blanket above it.
The robot feals warm, and stops shivering.
The robot soon realises that you are cooking something very delicious and approaches toward you.
It is just you and your robot, having a silent dinner.
