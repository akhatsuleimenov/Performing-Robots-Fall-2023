#Storyline of the Movmement
<p>One snowy winter day, you are outside, middle of nowhere, cooking in front of a campfire.</p>
<p>You realise your robot pet is shivering, and decided to cover a blanket above it.</p>
<p>The robot feals warm, and stops shivering.</p>
<p>The robot soon realises that you are cooking something very delicious and approaches toward you.</p>
<p>It is just you and your robot, having a silent dinner.</p>
